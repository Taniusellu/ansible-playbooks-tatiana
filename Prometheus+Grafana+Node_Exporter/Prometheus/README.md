How does Prometheus  work ?
==========================
Prometheus is a leading open source monitoring and alerting tool. It had its origins at SoundCloud and has seen significant adoption since it was announced in 2015. The software was created because of the need to monitor multiple microservices that might be running in your system. Its architecture is modular and comes with several readily available modules called exporters, which help you capture metrics from the most popular software. Prometheus is written in the Go language, and it ships with easily distributed binaries that you can use to get it running as quickly as possible.
